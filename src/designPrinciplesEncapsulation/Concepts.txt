Encapsulation is the idea of combining fields and methods in
a class such that the methods operate on the data, as opposed to the users of the class
accessing the fi elds directly. In Java, it is commonly implemented with private instance
members that have public methods to retrieve or modify the data, commonly referred to
as getters and setters, respectively. 

With encapsulation, a class is able to maintain certain invariants about its internal data.
An invariant is a property or truth that is maintained even after the data is modified. For
example, imagine that we are designing a new Animal class, and we have the following
design requirements:
 *Each animal has a non null , non empty species field
 *Each animal has an age field that is greater than or equal to zero
