 You can perform a terminal operation without any intermediate operations but not the
other way around. This is why we will talk about terminal operations fi rst. Reductions are
a special type of terminal operation where all of the contents of the stream are combined
into a single primitive or Object. For example, you might have an int or a Collection .
