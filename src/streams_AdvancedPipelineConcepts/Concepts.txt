What happen when you have a list with two elements, then creates an stream of that list,
then you add a new element and finally, you count the elements of the stream?

Will you show 2 or 3 as result?

The answer is 3, because, as you remember, the streams are created as an assembly line, the info is created in the moment you need it, it menas, is lazy,
When you create the stream, contains two elements, but, when you make the count, pipeline starts and the stream looks in the soyurce, then founds 3 elements.
