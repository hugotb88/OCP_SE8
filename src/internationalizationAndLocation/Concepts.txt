Many applications need to work for different countries and with different languages. For
example, consider the sentence “The zoo is holding a special event on 4/1/15 to look at animal
behaviors.” When is the event? In the United States, it is on April 1. However a British
reader would interpret this as January 4. A British reader might also wonder why we didn’t
write “behaviours".

Internationalization
Is the process of designing your program so it can be adapted. This
involves placing strings in a property file and using classes like DateFormat so that the right
format is used based on user preferences. (Create a properties file)


-------------------------------------------------------

Localization
Means actually supporting multiple locales. Oracle defines a locale as “a
specific geographical, political, or cultural region.” You can think of a locale as being like
a language and country pairing. Localization includes translating strings to different languages


-------------------------------------------------------
Since internationalization and localization are such long words, they are often abbreviated
as internationalizationAndLocation.i18n and l10n


-------------------------------------------------------
Using a Resource Bundle
 A resource bundle contains the local specifi c objects to be used by a program. It is like a
map with keys and values. The resource bundle can be in a property fi le or in a Java class.
A property fi le is a fi le in a specific format with key/value pairs.

Our zoo program has been very successful. We are now getting requests to use it at three
more zoos! We already have support for United States–based zoos. We now need to add
Zoo de La Palmyre in France, the Greater Vancouver Zoo in English-speaking Canada, and
Zoo de Granby in French-speaking Canada.
We immediately realized that we are going to need to internationalize our program.
