A file is record within a file system that stores user and system data. Files are organized
using directories. A directory is a record within a file system that contains files as well
as other directories. For simplicity, we often refer to a directory reference as a file record
throughout this chapter, since it is stored in the file system with a unique name and with
attributes similar to a file. For example, a file and directory can both be renamed with the
same operation. Finally, the root directory is the topmost directory in the file system, from
which all files and directories inherit. In Windows, it is denoted with a drive name such as
c:\, while on Linux it is denoted with a single forward slash /.


Creating a File Object
A File object often is initialized with String containing either an absolute or relative path
to the file or directory within the file system. The absolute path of a file or directory is the
full path from the root directory to the file or directory, including all subdirectories that
contain the file or directory. Alternatively, the relative path of a file or directory is the path
from the current working directory to file or directory.

exists()                     Returns true if the file or directory exists.
getName()                    Returns the name of the file or directory denoted by this path.
getAbsolutePath()            Returns the absolute pathname string of this path.
isDirectory()                Returns true if the file denoted by this path is a directory.
isFile()                     Returns true if the file denoted by this path is a file.
length()                     Returns the number of bytes in the file. For performance reasons, the
                             file system may allocate more bytes on disk than the file actually uses.
lastModified()               Returns the number of milliseconds since the epoch when the file
                             was last modified.
delete()                     Deletes the file or directory. If this pathname denotes a directory,
                             then the directory must be empty in order to be deleted.
renameTo(File)               Renames the file denoted by this path.
mkdir()                      Creates the directory named by this path.
mkdirs()                     Creates the directory named by this path including any nonexistent
                             parent directories.
getParent()                  Returns the abstract pathname of this abstract pathnameâ€™s parent
                             or null if this pathname does not name a parent directory.
listFiles()                  Returns a File[] array denoting the files in the directory.
