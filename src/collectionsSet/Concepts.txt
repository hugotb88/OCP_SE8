You use a set when you don’t want to allow duplicate entries.

For example, you might want to keep track of the unique animals that you want to see at the zoo. You aren’t
concerned with the order in which you see these animals, but there isn’t time to see
them more than once 

--- Set Implementations --
A HashSet stores its elements in a hash table. This means that it uses the hashCode()
method of the objects to retrieve them more efficiently.

A TreeSet stores its elements in a sorted tree structure. The main benefit is that the set
is always in sorted order. The tradeoff is that adding and checking if an element is present
are both O(log n). TreeSet implements a special interface called NavigableSet, which
lets you slice up the collection
