Suppose that you are taking an introductory Java class and receive scores of 90 and 100
on the first two exams. Now, we ask you what your average is. An average is calculated by
adding the scores and dividing by the number of scores, so you have (90+100)/2. This gives
190/2, so you answer with 95. Great!
Now suppose that you are taking your second class on Java, and it is the first day of
class. We ask you what your average is in this class that just started. You haven’t taken any
exams yet, so you don’t have anything to average. It wouldn’t be accurate to say that your
average is zero. That sounds bad, and it isn’t true. There simply isn’t any data, so you don’t
have an average yet.
How do we express this “we don’t know” or “not applicable” answer in Java? Starting
with Java 8, we use the Optional type. An Optional is created using a factory. You can
either request an empty Optional or pass a value for the Optional to wrap. Think of an
Optional as a box that might have something in it or might instead be empty.
