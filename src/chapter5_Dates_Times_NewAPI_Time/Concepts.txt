In Java 8, Oracle completely revamped how we work with dates and times. You can still
write code the old way, but those classes aren’t on the exam.

You need an import to work with the date and time classes. Most of them are in the
java.time package. To use it, add this import to your program:
import java.time.*; // import time classes


Periods and Durations

You’ve probably noticed by now that a Period is a day or more of time. There is also
Duration, which is intended for smaller units of time. For Duration, you can specify the
number of days, hours, minutes, seconds, or nanoseconds. And yes, you could pass 365
days to make a year, but you really shouldn’t—that’s what Period is for.
Conveniently, Duration roughly works the same way as Period, except it is used with
objects that have time. Remember that a Period is output beginning with a P. Duration
is output beginning with PT, which you can think of as a period of time. A Duration
is stored in hours, minutes, and seconds. The number of seconds includes fractional
seconds

Both classes can be used to represent an amount of time or determine the difference between two dates.
The main distinction between the two classes is that Period uses date-based values, while Duration uses time-based values.
