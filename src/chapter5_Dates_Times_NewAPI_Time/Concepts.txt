In Java 8, Oracle completely revamped how we work with dates and times. You can still
write code the old way, but those classes arenâ€™t on the exam.

You need an import to work with the date and time classes. Most of them are in the
java.time package. To use it, add this import to your program:
import java.time.*; // import time classes
