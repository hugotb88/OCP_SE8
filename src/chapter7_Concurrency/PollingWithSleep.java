 * Oftentimes, you need a thread to poll for a result to finish. Polling is the process of intermittently
 * checking data at some fixed interval. For example, letâ€™s say that you have a thread
 * that modifies a shared static counter value and your main() thread is waiting for the
 * thread to increase the value above 100
