 We discussed “order” for the TreeSet and TreeMap classes. For numbers, order is
obvious—it is numerical order. For String objects, order is defi ned according to the
Unicode character mapping

 You can also sort objects that you create. Java provides an interface called Comparable .
If your class implements Comparable , it can be used in these data structures that require
comparison.

There is also a class called Comparator , which is used to specify that you want
to use a different order than the object itself provides. 


---Comparable---

 The Comparable interface has only one method. In fact, this is the entire interface:
 
 public interface Comparable<T> {
 	public int compareTo(T o);
 } 
 
 
 We still need to know what the compareTo() method returns so that we can write our
own. There are three rules to know:

** The number zero is returned when the current object is equal to the argument to compareTo().
** A number less than zero is returned when the current object is smaller than the argument
to compareTo().
** A number greater than zero is returned when the current object is larger than the argument
to compareTo().
